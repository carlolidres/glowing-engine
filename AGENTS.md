# AI Project Continuity and Handoff System

## Purpose

This repository uses a versioned AI handoff system to ensure continuity between coding sessions, coding agents, and project iterations.

Every coding session must leave behind a complete record of:

* What was requested
* What was implemented
* What was not implemented
* What problems were encountered
* What lessons were learned
* What should happen next

---

## Required Folder Structure

The project must contain this structure:

```text
PROJECT_ROOT/
│
├── AGENTS.md
├── agent-history/
│   ├── version-0-baseline.md
│   ├── version-1-handoff.md
│   ├── version-2-handoff.md
│   └── version-X-handoff.md
│
└── src/
```

All handoff files must be stored inside:

```text
agent-history/
```

The baseline file must be located at:

```text
agent-history/version-0-baseline.md
```

The latest handoff file must also be located inside:

```text
agent-history/
```

Example:

```text
agent-history/version-3-handoff.md
```

---

## Required Startup Procedure

Before making any change, the coding agent must:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Open the folder `agent-history/`.
3. Read `agent-history/version-0-baseline.md`.
4. Find the highest numbered handoff file inside `agent-history/`.
5. Read the latest handoff file completely.
6. Summarize the current project status.
7. Identify unfinished items.
8. Read the rules in `.agent/` folder.
9. Save token! If the task is big use graphify, follow the rule in `graphify` in .agent/ folder.
10. Make a plan and confirm the planned work before coding. Store it to .agent/plan/ folder in MarkDown format.
11. Do not start coding until the applicable baseline, latest handoff, and relevant .agent/rules/ files have been reviewed.
12. Always track the project progress based on the plan created in markdown format in the .agent/plan/ folder.

Example:

If these files exist:

```text
agent-history/version-0-baseline.md
agent-history/version-1-handoff.md
agent-history/version-2-handoff.md
```

The coding agent must read:

```text
agent-history/version-2-handoff.md
```

before starting new work.

## Version Chain

Example:

```text
agent-history/version-0-baseline.md
        ↓
agent-history/version-1-handoff.md
        ↓
agent-history/version-2-handoff.md
        ↓
agent-history/version-3-handoff.md
```

The latest version represents the current project state.

Previous versions must never be edited.

Previous versions are historical records.

---

## Hard Rules

Always:

* Read latest version from `agent-history/` before coding
* Create a new handoff inside `agent-history/` after coding
* Document assumptions
* Document risks
* Document lessons learned

Never:

* Delete previous handoffs
* Rewrite project history
* Claim testing without testing
* Modify baseline requirements without approval

## Git Traceability Requirement

Every handoff file must have exactly one corresponding Git commit.

A task is NOT complete unless:

* Handoff file exists inside `agent-history/`
* Git commit exists
* Commit hash is recorded in the handoff file
* Commit message is recorded in the handoff file

---

## Commit Format

```text
v[VERSION]: [summary]
```

Examples:

```text
v1: initialize project
v2: implement authentication
v3: add dashboard KPI cards
v4: implement notification engine
v5: fix validation workflow
```

---

## Completion Definition

Work is COMPLETE only if:

* Implementation completed
* Verification completed
* New handoff created inside `agent-history/`
* Next steps documented
